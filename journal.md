The school phone ban was unecessary. The goverment is focusing on the wrong things because This country has ALOT more and bigger issues to take care of. This economy and state is slowly falling apart but theyre biggist concern is cell phones at school. I understand that cell phones distract and prevent from having full on focus on school work but that is not all completly correct. Cell phones also help students,Students who suffer Anxiety or who are in a bad state mentally use music to forget about their problems and feel better or even music help students focus more and get their work done. The phone browser can also help students study or research things bassed on their assignment/project easily instead of taking 5 minutes to set up a computer or get a laptop out of their bag just to search one thing. Phones also provide proper and good communication,A student can easily be able to text thier parent or guardian without any probelms and they could also text a friend . This new law of the phone ban have made some teachers take advantige of it,Even before the phone ban teachers would yell at a student for simply just listening to music in the halls. The student would be minding their own business working or simply just texting a friend back after they finished their assignment then the teacher would proceed to scold or yell at them or some teachers would grab the students phone and throw or break it and that costs the students parents money.

A Career i am interested is in Graphic design and fashion design. Computer science would actually help in this career because they use websites and Design Softwheres,For example Jess Lee She designed a Website for her fashion and designs and to make that she used computer to make the website. she needed to program and code and control what the website does since people are gonna use the website and she had to design and format where everythings at. In Graphic design you need to deisgn logos or for a product brands,create fliers,Movie and Game covers. Things that require photoshop editing browsers and that browser is made with computer science too.

A Ai Project that i would like to invent is a Ai chat bot that could be a therapist for everyone world wide,What we would need is data tht is high quality and is well labled date to start this foundation. This ai bot would be helpful both for all the people because usally when someone tells another person about their problems and trauma and that information is gonna make the therapist feel more pressure to help that person along with their own problems and could affect both in mental health but with the ai the person talking about their probelms dosent have to feel guilty telling them all their probelms,The ai is also personally designed for the specific person after they answear a 10 minute servey. If The ai bot detects any deep probelms it will immidiety send a note to a actual perfesional and to a doctor for them.

IKEA paying players real money is a bad idea. People who actually work in ikea getting paid the same amount of money of people who sit in their home playing roblox is unfair to those who work. The workers get up early to work multipe hours a week and try to provide themselves a home and food and someworkers for their whole family. If i ran ikea want to provide a fun way to work in ikea with roblox i would change the payment to 1.50 or 2.10 an hour becaus in reality tey are not really working but just playing a game.

 the phrase "6, 7" Truly does not mean anything it is just a popular lyrics from the song "Skrilla" by Doot Doot. The reason why students say it and the tone is sometimes to describe something for example a student can say "I drank My soda 6-7 times" or they could say "My Soda was 6-7 dollars"

I Prompted The Canva Ai the create a Review and mini interactive quiz. I specifically said to typed to make it a "Colorful bright colors but not too strong". The reason was for strong colors can be oversimulating for some people. I made it to be for younger students like first graders so the review can be easy and direct.Canva did bring the exact idea i had in mind. The only thing that didint work out well was Some words were messed up like the font was messed up since its difficut to generate words sometimes. Other than the letters everything was good and it even generated a interactive image. Something i could improve next time is to add a feature of multiple languages so kids who speak other language  could also learn from it. Good promt engineering could be a sucessful career because compapanies could use fun interactive websites or images for marketing and you could get paid good money just for providing the idea and prompting it.

 Technology can be helpful because it can give us a prediction and an idea of what to expect from the natural disaster. By giving us an idea what can happen we can plan and prepare ahead to stay safe. For example when Scientist gave out for the Hurricane Milton Recently it gave people time to move out. Technology can also help us see where the hurricane is located and where it is going and predicts whereit could go next. Technology can also show the danger of the natural disaster by the color coding,example they use red for danger and green for safer.

When SNAP funding runs out, it's a huge problem because millions of low-income families and especially kids and adults and older people can lose their main way to buy groceries. Technology could really help by creating a simple emergency app that uses your location if they allow it to and instantly show all the available food banks, pantries, and free meal sites nearby or even community food events to help families. This app could also show what items they have in stock. The biggest challenge for these solutions is how many people who need help don't have reliable internet access or a smartphone to use the app. We also need to be very careful with everyone's private information. If I were the designer, my tool would be called "alwaysfed" a basic website that quickly sends a text message with the addresses of nearby pantries and meal sites.

The most important thing I learned this semester was definitely how to plan ahead for all my big assignments. I finally got good at breaking down huge things like research papers into smaller steps instead of just waiting until the night before. This new habit proved that when I start early, I feel way less stressed and end up doing better quality work. Next year since things are going to be harder I want to use this more organized strategy to keep improving. I’ll make sure to use my planning system to manage new sports or clubs and keep my school life  or any hard school subjects under control. Basically, this skill will help me handle tougher classes and still have time for my own.

Since drones are used for so much more than just deliveries, the job I think is the coolest is being a Drone Mapping Specialist. This role focuses on applied science and they plan flight paths to collect high resolution data on things like coastal erosion or wildlife habitats. Programming is essential because coders write the autonomous flight algorithms and which use computer vision for real time obstacle avoidance to enabling the drone to navigate intelligently like the Source is Unmanned Systems Technology. To work commercially, you have to get the FAA Part 107 license. After that, you get to work with specialized GIS and mapping software to process the large amounts of imagery. Plus the pay is pretty decent for starting out and since the average Drone Mapping salary in Texas is about $55,422 annually the (Source: ZipRecruiter, Nov 2025). I would definitely want to do this job in the future because it’s the perfect blend of tech and the outdoors, where my programming knowledge translates into measurable results.

Autocraft was created as a privete minecraft server for kids with autism to play witout being bullied. it solves the problem of regular online games having too many peopl to harras and exclude players for being different. Safe spaces like this needed because without moderation people can say really rude things and might make the other player feel sad and unsafe. Developers have responsibility to design those spaces becuasse if they leave safety up to the users bullying will continue. Autocraft uses clear rules and uses a strong community to make sure everyone feels comfoterble being themselves.if developers ignore safety then people woulnt want to even play games online anymore

One way technology can help create fairness is by giving everyone acess to information online . This matters because in the past only people with money for expensive books could learn about important things. Now anyone with a phone can look up their rights. An example of this could be how people use social media to film and share when they see something unfair happening in their community. This helps people get treated more fairly because the world can see the truth and it holds everyone accountable for their actions. Technology makes it harder for people to hiide injustice whih helps everyone in the end.
